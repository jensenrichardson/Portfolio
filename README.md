# Portfolio
Hello! Here is where I keep my data science portfolio.

My name is Jensen Richardson and I am a recent graduate and aspiring data scientist with experience integrating data and disparate
tools to provide insights. I am searching for a place to continue my ambition to discover, learn, and solve
unfamiliar problems.

## 1. Regression — [Kaggle's Ames Iowa House Price Challenge](https://www.kaggle.com/code/jensenrichardson/house-prices-prediction)
In the following notebook, I go through several different models to predict house prices for homes in Ames, Iowa.
After a lengthy exploratory data analysis, I develop models using traditional linear methods, gradient boosted trees, and a deep learning neural network.
I use tools from pandas, scikit-learn, and keras most intensively.

## 2. Classification — [Kaggle's Space Titanic Disaster Challenge](https://www.kaggle.com/code/jensenrichardson/space-titanic-model)
The problem is to predict whether or not passengers on the Space Titanic are transported into another dimension.
This is a classification problem and has many missing entries (we get the information from a damaged computer core).
I use tools from pandas, scikit-learn, XGBoost, and keras most intensively.

## 3. Data Structure — [Data Ingest Script](https://github.com/jensenrichardson/dna-preprocess/blob/main/parse_samples.py)
The data ingest script I wrote while a part of the Big Data in Biology lab at UT was used to start an intensive data pipeline (available in the same repository).
The specific script available here comprehends a complex data structure (that of individual paired reads (two in a lane), with multiple lanes per sample) and not only
verifies that structure, but makes the structure available for other commands in the pipeline.
It is well commented, well structured, and flexible code that I used to extend other parts of the pipeline over the course of a year and a half (the git history is fairly blank because almost all of my work was completed on a headless cluster at [TACC](https://www.tacc.utexas.edu).
